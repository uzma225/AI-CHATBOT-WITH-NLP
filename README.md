# DESCRIPTION

In this task, we are required to create a basic chatbot using Python and NLP (Natural Language Processing) libraries like NLTK or spaCy. A chatbot is a computer program that can simulate a conversation with a human user. It understands text input (what the user types) and responds in a meaningful way.
Install NLP Library
First, we need to install a Python library for NLP. we can use NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), which is a popular and beginner-friendly library.

Define Question and Answer Pairs
we will write a list of common questions and how our chatbot should respond. For example:

User: "Hi"

Bot: "Hello! How can I help you today?"
Create the Chatbot Script
weâ€™ll use Python code to build the chatbot. The chatbot should be able to:

Start a conversation

Match user input to predefined patterns

Give appropriate responses

End the conversation when the user says "bye" or "quit"

Test the Chatbot
After writing the code, we will run the script in our terminal and talk to our chatbot by typing messages.
